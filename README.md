# Docsy Plus

Additions for the [docsy theme](https://github.com/google/docsy) for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), used for training content.
The docsy-plus theme inherites from the docsy theme through Hugos [Theme Components](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/theme-components/).


## Installation

To add the docsy and docsy-plus themes to an existing Hugo project, run the following commands from your projectâ€™s root directory:

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/google/docsy.git themes/docsy
git submodule add https://github.com/puzzle/docsy-plus.git themes/docsy-plus
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Reference both themes in your configuration, the docsy-plus needs to come first.

Example config.toml:

```toml
theme = ["docsy-plus", "docsy"]
```


## Shortcodes

For docsy shortcodes see here: [Docsy Shortcodes](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/adding-content/shortcodes/).

## Enhanced Cover Block

The blocks/cover shortcode from [docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/adding-content/iconsimages/#add-images) has been enhanced in order to support config-dependend background an logo images.

If you add a imagePrefix settings under your sties params, this prefix is used to search for background and log images.

As example with the following setting:

```toml
[params]
imagePrefix = "fancy_"
```
Backgound images which contain "fancy_background" and logo images with "fancy_logo" in the filename are detected.


## Details

A shortcode to generate HTML _details_ and _summary_ tags, which is handy to make solutions foldable in the labs sections.

Usage:

```html
{{% details title="Lab 1" %}}
Lab 1 solution
{{% /details %}}
```


## OnlyWhen and OnlyWhenNot

This shortcode is used to display or hide content based on enables modules.

Example modules configuration within your sites config.toml:

```toml
enabledModule = "base extra"
```

Use the shortcode as follows:

```html
{{< onlyWhen extra >}}
This is only displayed if extra is enabled.
{{< /onlyWhen >}}

{{< onlyWhenNot extra >}}
This only shown if extra is NOT enabled.
{{< /onlyWhenNot >}}
```
